# 2.5 Sum Lists
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
The digits are stored in _reverse_ order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.
Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. 

## Example
Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617 + 295.

Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.
